                Hello and welcome to my website! I'm James, and I'm currently in my first year of
                BSc Digital Media at UWE in Bristol. Below you will find my work for the 4 tasks 
                we've been set for this first semester. Each task can be quickly accessed by clicking on the

            <section id="CARPTask">
              <h2>CARP Task</h2>

              <div id="true-false-1" class="true-false">
                <img class="TrueFalseDesign1" src="images/true-false-1.png" alt="images ofmy CARP poster designs">

              </div> 

              <p class="reflection-paragraph">This was a fun task; however, it didn’t start off that way.
                 I undeniably spent the most amount of time on my first design. For the longest time, I
                 had included the warped “True/False Festival” heading as seen in my third poster. This
                 didn’t look right. I was frustrated with how bad the poster looked like for a while.
                 But after considering the emphasis of Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity,
                 I decided to take a different approach. Two out of three posters included the
                 contrast of the black text – white background/white text – red background. This can
                 also be viewed as repetition, as it imitates the same colour scheme as the
                 True/False logo. I also attempted to do this with the inclusion of the ‘scribbled’
                 black lines that enclose the text, which I feel also compliments and takes
                 inspiration from the logo. However, with that being said, it also runs the risk
                 of appearing too messy, and adding unnecessary busyness to the aesthetic. The
                 repetition on the second poster can be seen with a 'true’ and ‘false’ print
                 being repeated in the background behind the white text. Regarding alignment
                 and proximity, I feel all of the text on the posters has visual connections
                 between the backgrounds and headings accordingly. In my opinion, posters 2
                 and 3 include better proximity, with the location and date of the festival
                 being just underneath the main heading. This allows the reader to quicky
                 identify all of the key information from just an initial glance. 
                 Despite the third poster possibly coming across as being the simplest, as well as the
                 most uninspired, I feel it is the most successful design overall. The design first
                 takes the True/False logo, and extends the red and white division so it spans across
                 the whole page. I’m proud of the contrast of the black text on the white and white
                 text on red. Due to my limited experience with InDesign, it was difficult
                 to create the 'colour split' effect within the same word, such as in “festival” and
                 “Truefalse.org”. I had to opt to zooming in as close as possible and roughly
                 covering the small portions of the letters that overlapped with rectangle shapes
                 and lines from the pencil tool. I’m sure there must have been a quicker, easier
                 way to achieve what I was going for, but I was unable to work it out.</p>

                 <div id="true-false-4" class="true-false">
                  <img class="TrueFalseDesign4" src="images/true false design-4.png">
                </div> 

                <p class="reflection-paragraph">My final poster stems from the third design in having 
                a similar centered "T/F" logo. this time I decided to use an image, opposed to the more traditional 
                logo from the previous three. By doing this I feel it adds depth to the poster. I also wanted to ensure I takled the issue of too much unused space, 
                a problem i feel that the other posters suffer from. In my opinion, having a black background colour
                creates far better contrast. The heading, location and date fit together at the top in a jigsaw-like 
                fashion, showing better arrangement and proximity, whilst the bottom text is arraged in a grid. I made the
                black boxes housing the text more transparent intentionally, just because I pefer the look of having 
                the slight corners of the image below exposed.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="opening-paragraph">Axial</p>
            <p class="reflection-paragraph">An axial design can be created by placing your text either side of
             an imaginary line (axis). This can either be an implicit or explicit axis, symmetrical or
             asymmetrical too.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Radial</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Created by choosing an initial focal point and styling your text to
              “radiate” out of it. Can sometimes prove difficult to read, so establishing a clear hierarchy of
              text is important.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Dilatational</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">These are designs that are set to follow around a circular path.
             Can also be hard to read. If the text creates a full circle, then some of it will appear upside
             down.</p> 
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Grid</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Universal type system; works in just about any format. The text
             and the graphics can be arranged into neat columns and rows.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Transitional</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Works better when used on posters or as a book cover. Resembles
             layers of sediment in the earth. Aiming for natural looking composition.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Bilateral</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Bilateral designs are also known as text that is centred. It is often
             symmetrical as well. Can be made to look more interesting by utilising horizontal, vertical and
             non-objective elements.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Modular</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Text that is layed out in repeating structures, such as within shapes.
             Perfect to use with pieces of content that have been already cut up.</p>
             <p class="opening-paragraph">Random</p>
             <p class="reflection-paragraph">Essentially combining all of the above typographic systems and mashing
             them all into a layout that is either readable or completely illegible. Go nuts!</p>
             
            
            
          

              <p class="reflection-paragraph"> Out of all the tasks that were required for the assignment,
                 the typography task was personally the easiest one to get on with. This was due to the online
                 resources I was able to refer to and the uncomplicated, effortless layout of tools available
                 on Illustrator. I initiated the task by taking on the Dilatational style first. Once I was
                 able to locate the “type on path” tool, I could draw multiple circles and then creatively
                 adjust the text to my liking. This tool was also useful when working in the Transitional
                 style too, with the only difference being I would type on the path of lines that were
                 created free-hand. Personally, I am satisfied with how the majority of the posters came
                 out, particularly, again the Dilatational and Transitional styles. I also like the Random
                 design as well because it was the most fun to create. The designs I’m not as pleased with
                 are the Bilateral and Modular styles. The Bilateral one I feel is a bit too boring. I
                 felt more restricted with this, as it’s simply centred text. I did experiment with moving
                 a tilting the text, but it didn’t look as aesthetically pleasing, so I decided to make it
                 a bit more interesting with the inclusion of the layered square shapes. I feel like I
                 was also lacking creativity with the Modular design as well. Although it is up to par
                 with the specifications, I believe it falls short in the sense of it not being as striking
                 or imaginative as some of the other designs.</p>

                <p class="reflection-paragraph">For someone who had absolutely zero experience
                   in coding before joining this course, the coding task contained the perfect balance of
                   straight forward instructions, and clues that prompted you to try and figure out how
                   something worked for yourself. This task was also able to demonstrate the rewarding
                   side of coding, where you can look back on a finished website and say to yourself “I
                   really did that”, or when you are adjusting a style sheet and you’re finally able to
                   get a photo to a certain size, or find the exact colour for your text that you were
                   looking for. The coding task played a pivotal role in giving me the basic skills in
                   order to create this website you’re reading this on now. Some aspects of this were
                   challenging, so I would put the task off and it would take me a while to get back
                   around to it to finish it off. But it wasn’t impossible. All the information I
                   needed was there, even if it meant referring back to a previous week’s worksheet.
                   Honestly this was the best way for me personally to wrap my head around coding
                   with HTML/CSS.</p>

              <p class="reflection-paragraph">Scope – The function of my website is host all of my assignments
                 that I've been tasked for the first semester of BSc Digital Media year one. These include:
                 the CARP task, Typography posters, screenshots of the coding task and links to view them on
                 GitHub, and the User experience breakdown. It will be a single-scrolling website and contain
                 anchor links at the top to quickly jump to the desired task you would like to view. Hopefully,
                 it will also be responsive when the size of the screen is adjusted. I intend each of the task
                 sections to be colour coded, in order to create a clean and clear experience for the
                 website's users.</p>

                 <p class="reflection-paragraph">Strategy – this website, that will act as my own personal
                    portfolio could be used my classmates, Mary Jackson and Mic Palmer, friends and family, and
                    possibly even potential employers. Viewers of the website should be able to quickly
                    identify the work enclosed, as well as have navigation simple and intuitive enough, that
                    someone using it for the first time can understand it's functionality. As well as all of
                    this, this website is the result of everything that I’ve learned so far. Just a couple of
                    months ago, if tasked with the same project, I most likely would be unable to recreate
                    the simplest of aspects of the task. I certainly wouldn’t have anything close to a website.
                    With that being said, I am proud of all I've been able to achieve in such a short amount
                    of time, and I wish to continue to grow my graphic design repertoire over the next couple
                    of years.</p>

            <section id="Overview">
               <h2>Reflection Report</h2>
               
               <p class="reflection-paragraph">For me this assignment felt like a jump in the deep end for the
                first time. I’ve had to quickly learn and adapt to new programs, software and then develop 
                skills within these programs and honestly, I wasn’t sure whether I would be left floating, or if I'd sink. 
                For a long time, I was cruising at a steady pace, not really taking into the consideration of time constraints. I was 
                getting by, tackling the subjectively easier tasks first, so the initial one I started was the typography posters. However, 
                very quickly I had found myself at the first obstacle: I had started creating the posters in InDesign, rather than 
                Illustrator, as stated on the brief. But I can say I am satisfied with how these turned out in the end. Are 
                they executed with intricacy and extreme attention to detail? Most definitely not, but that’s okay. In my opinion, 
                I opted to take a more simplistic approach to this challenge and I feel there’s a clear correlation 
                between each poster in terms of theme, which was exactly what I was going for. The coding worksheets came next. 
                I was able to comfortably get on with the initial two, but when I came to seeing styling with CSS for the first time 
                and linking other pages, I hesitated, and decided I would revisit it later. After this, I took 
                on the CARP task. Again, rather slowly. I created a mock-up of the first poster and really didnt like the design I produced. 
                I remember scanning the room, catching glimpses of the posters made my fellow classmates, thinking 
                “mine is so bad compared to theirs”. It was at this point I came to the conclusion I would return to the 
                coding task sheets and design a few wireframes and a flowchart for UX. And I'm glad I went back to this, because these coding 
                sheets were imperative in the creation of my own website. I took inspiration from the Flexbox sheet and 
                was able to make it my own somewhat successfully, I hope? Again, I cannot stress enough how perfect 
                the worksheets were laid out. they were so easy to follow and contained a good number of challenges that 
                required looking back and finding out. Going back to the posters, I am happy in the way I can see visual 
                improvement, with each one being better than the last. Foolishly, I did leave the creation of the 
                website dangerously late because of feeling of being lost and not knowing where or how to start. 
                There was also added pressure from my peers seeing how amazing all of theirs were coming along 
                after asking for advice. After allowing a moment to re-evaluate, I focused all my energy on getting 
                everything done and polished before piecing it all together a week before the deadline in class time. 
                For a simple design, I am proud of what I was able to eventually produce. I especially like how the 
                tasks are divided into the exact main colours that were present in each individual task. This was a 
                last-minute addition, but definitely one that adds the most aesthetic appeal.</p>
