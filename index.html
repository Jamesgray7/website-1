              <p class="reflection-paragraph">This was a fun task; however, it didn’t start off that way.
                 I undeniably spent the most amount of time on my first design. For the longest time, I
                 had included the warped “True/False Festival” heading as seen in my third poster. This
                 didn’t look right. I was frustrated with how bad the poster looked like for a while.
                 But after considering the emphasis of Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity,
                 I decided to take a different approach. Two out of three posters included the
                 contrast of the black text – white background/white text – red background. This can
                 also be viewed as repetition, as it imitates the same colour scheme as the
                 True/False logo. I also attempted to do this with the inclusion of the ‘scribbled’
                 black lines that enclose the text, which I feel also compliments and takes
                 inspiration from the logo. However, with that being said, it also runs the risk
                 of appearing too messy, and adding unnecessary busyness to the aesthetic. The
                 repetition on the second poster can be seen with a 'true’ and ‘false’ print
                 being repeated in the background behind the white text. Regarding alignment
                 and proximity, I feel all of the text on the posters has visual connections
                 between the backgrounds and headings accordingly. In my opinion, posters 2
                 and 3 include better proximity, with the location and date of the festival
                 being just underneath the main heading. This allows the reader to quicky
                 identify all of the key information from just an initial glance. 
                 Despite the third poster possibly coming across as being the simplest, as well as the
                 most uninspired, I feel it is the most successful design overall. The design first
                 takes the True/False logo, and extends the red and white division so it spans across
                 the whole page. I’m proud of the contrast of the black text on the white and white
                 text on red. Due to my limited experience with InDesign however, it was difficult
                 to create the colour split within the same word, such as in “festival” and
                 “Truefalse.org”. I had to opt to zooming in as close as possible and roughly
                 covering the small portions of the letters that overlapped with rectangle shapes
                 and lines from the pencil tool. I’m sure there must have been a quicker, easier
                 way to achieve what I was going for, but I was unable to work it out.</p>

              <p class="reflection-paragraph"> Out of all the tasks that were required for the assignment,
                 the typography task was personally the easiest one to get on with. This was due to the online
                 resources I was able to refer to and the uncomplicated, effortless layout of tools available
                 on Illustrator. I initiated the task by taking on the Dilatational style first. Once I was
                 able to locate the “type on path” tool, I could draw multiple circles and then creatively
                 adjust the text to my liking. This tool was also useful when working in the Transitional
                 style too, with the only difference being I would type on the path of lines that were
                 created free-hand. Personally, I am satisfied with how the majority of the posters came
                 out, particularly, again the Dilatational and Transitional styles. I also like the Random
                 design as well because it was the most fun to create. The designs I’m not as pleased with
                 are the Bilateral and Modular styles. The Bilateral one I feel is a bit too boring. I
                 felt more restricted with this, as it’s simply centred text. I did experiment with moving
                 a tilting the text, but it didn’t look as aesthetically pleasing, so I decided to make it
                 a bit more interesting with the inclusion of the layered square shapes. I feel like I
                 was also lacking creativity with the Modular design as well. Although it is up to par
                 with the specifications, I believe it falls short in the sense of it not being as striking
                 or imaginative as some of the other designs.</p>
